# DenScript-5x5-Strip-Board

Youâ€™ve probably heard of prototyping boards, but what are Strip Boards?

A Strip Board is just like a prototyping board, except the pads are connected in tracks, meaning you can more easily make circuits! Using a small hand drill (sold separately), you can cut the tracks, and using wires you can connect tracks.

Perfect for projects that you need to prototype quickly, in a DenBlock format, complete with M4 mounting holes in each corner so you can easily attach your prototype to your projects!
